  <h1>Welcome to the reading circle!</h1>
  This semester, David & Jakob would like to read Karen Barad's "Meeting the Universe Halfway: 
  Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning" - would you like to join?
  <h2>Session #1 on Friday, 7 November</h2>
  <p>We will meet for the first time on Friday, 7 November at 6 p.m. in a room in the Physics Faculty 
    tba and discuss the general project and possibly the introduction of "Meeting the Universe Halfway", 
    but don't worry if you can't read it until then, the first meeting is more for getting to know each other.</p>
